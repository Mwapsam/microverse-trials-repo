            He has led no armies into battle – he has conquered no countries –
            he has enslaved no peoples – yet he wields a power the magnitude of
            which no warrior ever dreamed. He commands a devotion more sweeping
            in scope, more world-wide than any other living man – a devotion
            rooted deep in human gratitude, and untinged by bias of race, color,
            religion or politics.

            They call him the “Wizard of Menlo Park.” They call him a “genius” –
            but he dismisses such adulation with a wave of the hand. Once, when
            pressed for a definition of genius, he coined the adage, “Genius is
            onc percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.”
